 * 1.	Using the graph as figure 7.1,
 * a)	Write out the results of topological sorting
 * b)	Write a program to perform a topological sort according to the pseudocode showed in Figure 9.7 in the textbook.
 * 2.	Write a program to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve the single-source shortest path problem(the source is A) of the graph in Figure 7.2, and write out the results.
 * 3.	Write a program to implement Prim’s algorithm to get a minimum spanning tree from the graph in Figure 7.3, and write out the result.
